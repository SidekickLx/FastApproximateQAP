ABSTRACT:
Graph matching (GM) - the process of finding an optimal permutation of the vertices of one graph to minimize adjacency disagreements with the vertices of another - is rapidly becoming an increasingly important computational problem, arising in fields ranging from machine vision to neuroscience. Because GM is NP-hard, exact algorithms are unsuitable for today's large graphs (with >1000 vertices). Approximate algorithms necessarily employ a accuracy/efficiency trade-off. We developed a fast approximate quadratic assignment algorithm (FAQ). FAQ scales cubicly with the number of vertices, similar to other approximate GM algorithms. Our formulation, however, achieves a lower objective function value than all previously proposed algorithms on over 93% of the QAPLIB benchmark problems. Moreover, our algorithm runs faster than the second best algorithm on over 80% of the benchmarks. We therefore implement our algorithm on a dataset of increasing interest to the neurobiology community: the brain-graph (connectome) of the C. elegans. FAQ solves this problem perfectly, and no other algorithm we tried was successful. Future work will hopefully improve upon the cubic complexity of FAQ to be able to match mammalian brain-graphs, with millions or billions of vertices.
