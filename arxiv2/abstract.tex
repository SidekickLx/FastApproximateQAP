Graph matching (GM)---the process of finding an optimal permutation of the vertices of one graph to minimize adjacency disagreements with the vertices of another---is rapidly becoming an increasingly important computational problem, arising in fields ranging from machine vision to chemical engineering to neuroscience. Because GM is NP-hard, exact algorithms are unsuitable for today's massive graphs; yet, scalable GM algorithms have received short shrift.  GM can be formulated as a quadratic program with linear and binary constraints.  We develop a fast approximate quadratic (FAQ) assignment algorithm to approximately solve a relaxed quadratic program with only linear constraints.  FAQ scales cubicly with the number of vertices, and demonstrates marked improvements over previous state-of-the-art on nearly all benchmarks. Moreover, our non-convex formulation facilitates multiple restarts; 2-3 wisely chosen initial conditions yield the best objective function on all benchmarks. We find qualitatively similar results for our motivating application: brain-graph matching.  Unfortunately, the computational complexity of FAQ scales too poorly to use it for mammalian brain-graphs, with millions or billions of vertices.  To inspire further development of approximate solutions to these problems, this work is available from on the first author's website, http://jovo.me.
