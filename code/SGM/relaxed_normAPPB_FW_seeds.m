% This is an implementation of the Frank-Wolfe method for solving the following optimization problem:
% min_{P \in D} ||AP - PB||_F^2
% where D is the set of doubly stochastic matrices, A and B are square matrices.
% This optimization problem comes from the Graph Matching Problem, when relaxing the set of permutation matrices to its convex hull, which is the set of doubly stochastic matrices. Here A and B are de adjacency matrices of the two graphs to match. 
% When, in addition, the first nodes of each graph are already in correspondance (called "seeds"), this information can be added to help the algorithm. 
% Here, the argument "seeds" is an integer which indicates the number of nodes that are already in correspondance. It's assumed that these nodes are the first ones.
